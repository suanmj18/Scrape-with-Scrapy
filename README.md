# Scrape-with-Scrapy
This is the basic implementation of Scrapy Framework in Python to scrape the data from the Website https://insider.in/all-digital-events-in-online and 
https://www.naadyogacouncil.com/en/events/ and scrape the complete data of interesting events(top 10 events of the page) from the given website. The scraped data is then stored into
mongoDB database creating different tables for different spiders.
